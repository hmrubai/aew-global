                <h2 class="mb-4">Why AEW?</h2> At AEW, we care for nursing students' creativity and innovative way of writing. Students should be focusing on their own writing ability than using AI-based proofreading services. If they do not write, their creativity would be hampered, proactive thinking along with problem-solving skills will go down! Conventional AI-based proofreading services rarely offer human-centric interactive feedback and sometimes offer correction, failing to consider the student's writing background. At AEW service, students will get human-centric corrections and fall in love with creative English writing.
